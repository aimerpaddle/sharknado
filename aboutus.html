<p>Sharknado HQ is where you will find all the cutting edge Shark technologies. Our team has worked very hard to bring you the best of the best.

  
  Sharknado was formed from an intense collaboration of thrill seekers, bent on diving into the world of shark attacks on land.  Each foray with the toothy beasts exposed challenges to be conquered. With a our new and trusted weapons of github, we pounded out and navigated a way to success.  

Currently accepting applications for underwater bait and chum associates.

<!-- HOW WE DID IT -->
<h2>
<a name="support-or-contact" class="anchor" href="#support-or-contact"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How We Did It</h2>

<p>Using GitHub pages, we are able to create a website quickly and efficiently.  The steps to creating a GitHub webpage are simple and straightforward:<br><br></p>

<h4>Step 1:</h4>
<p>Go to the <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages webpage</a>, scroll down slightly until you see two buttons that say <q>User or organization site</q> and <q>Project site</q>.  Select <q>Project site</q>.</p>

<h4>Step 2:</h4>
<p>The page will have several steps to show you how to create your very own GitHub webpage.  If you follow the steps on the website you should have no problem creating a GitHub page.<br></p>

<h4>Step 3:</h4>
<p>The last step is to add content by going to your gh-pages branch in your repository and editing the source filles as you see fit.<br></p>

<h4>*Note:</h4>
<p>Creating a GitHub page for a repository will create a branch called <q>gh-pages</q>.  So, if you want to work on your Github pages, make sure that you are pulling from and pushing to the <q>gh-pages</q> branch.  Some helpful commands to know would be:<br><br></p>
<p>git clone &ndash;b &lt;branchname&gt; &lt;URL&gt;</p>
<p>This allows you to get the code from a branch in the repository.<br><br></p>
<p>git push origin HEAD:&lt;branchname&gt;</p>
<p>Pushes changes to a specific branch in the repository.<br><br></p>

<!-- The line breaks before the closing paragraph tag is to create white-space on the bottom of the page-->
<p>If you are working in a team with multiple people working on the same files it will be useful to be able to sync your fork.  Syncing your fork allows you to get the current version of the website so that you are not accidentally working on an older version of the website.  GitHub provides a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork">help page</a> about how to sync a fork that is very helpful.<br><br><br><br><br></p>
