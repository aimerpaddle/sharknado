<p>My name is Amar and I am working on getting a Bachelors degree in CS. I will start at Weber State in the Spring will hopefully be done by next year. I currently work at a startup company here in the valley as a software engineer. I love watching sports, specifically the NFL and NBA. I'm a huge Lakers fan (I get a lot of crap for that since it's "forbidden" here in Jazz country).</p>

<p>Hello and greetings from Shark infested waters.  I am currently swimming towards a CS degree, but the currents are strong and safe shores are not seen.  My previous adventure was in the wonderful world of printing ( Bigger sharks and more tornados ). So I hope this exploration into the vast oceans of computer technology will bring me to a safe harbor- currents willing.  Specialities include shark hunting, shark fillets, and shark teeth peddling. Cheers.   </p>

<p>I am going into Computer Science for my main major but I want to also get a degree in Mathematics and Physics.  So far I only need a few more classes to complete a Math and computer science associates.  Once I am finished at SLCC, I will transfer to The University of Utah for a Bachelors and Masters in Computer Science.</p>
